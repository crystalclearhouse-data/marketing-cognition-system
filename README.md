# Marketing Cognition System

The "forever-compounding" engine for marketing: **Sense → Decide → Act → Measure → Remember → Evolve**.

## The Loop

1.  **Sense**: Gather signals (questions, objections, wins, losses) from the market.
2.  **Decide**: Use Decision Rules to pivot, kill, or scale campaigns.
3.  **Act**: Execute campaigns and content.
4.  **Measure**: Track leading indicators and KPIs.
5.  **Remember**: Log insights in the Memory Vault.
6.  **Evolve**: Update Core Beliefs and Language Rules based on evidence.

## Weekly Cadence

This system runs on a **Weekly Cognition Review**.
- Review Signals Inbox.
- Review Active Experiments.
- Decide next week's Actions.
- Update Beliefs if necessary.

See [execution/weekly.md](execution/weekly.md) for the checklist.
