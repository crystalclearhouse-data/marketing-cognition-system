# Decision Rules

Clear criteria for making decisions to avoid emotional bias.

## Campaign Rules
- **Kill**: If no leading indicator movement after 2 weeks.
- **Pivot**: If engagement is high but conversion is low (tweak offer).
- **Scale**: If CPA is < Target and Volume is increasing.

## Experiment Rules
- Only run 1 major variable change at a time.
- Minimum sample size: [X] or [Y] days.
- If results are inconclusive, defaults to **Kill**.

## Signal Thresholds
- **Critical**: 3+ customers mention the same objection in 1 week -> Immediate "Objection Handling" sprint.
